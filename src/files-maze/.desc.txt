So you have beaten the last puzzle, good job!

You are a frog and are trapped in a maze. You need to find your way out. Below is an example of a maze.

<style>
  body {
    text-align: center;
  }
  .center-div {
    display: inline-block;
    text-align: left;
  }
</style>

<div style="width:50%; margin:0 auto;">
  %DELIM
</div>

The solution to this maze is `TODO`. But this answer is too long for the password system.
Therefore, you need to compress the answer. The compressed answer is `TODO`.

Here is the real maze for you to escape:

<div style="width:50%; margin:0 auto;">
  %DELIM
</div>

<p><b>Now solve the maze with compression.</b></p>
