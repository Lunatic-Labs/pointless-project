* Introduction

The point(less) of the /Pointless Project/ is to create a compelling, puzzle-filled
challenge inspired by the [[https://challenge.synacor.com][Synacor Challenge]], but targeted at a pre-college audience.
The goal is to allow the School of Computing (SoC) to engage potential
students during the time they are selecting a college by providing opportunities to remain in
contact, encourage curiosity, and engage in creative problem solving while learning about
computing and the SoC.

Playing through the Synacor Challenge will provide the clearest understanding, however reading
someone else's "[[https://github.com/KanegaeGabriel/synacor-challenge/blob/master/writeup.md][travel log]]" is also insightful. The key components to success include:
1. a personalized download containing the complete game
2. the ability to play completely offline
3. a series of different but related logic puzzles and riddles
4. multiple opportunities "along the way" to be recognized for their problem solving skills.

* Project Setup

** Installation

*** Linux (/recommened/)

For Debian based distributions, run:

#+begin_src bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install g++ libboost-all-dev libzip-dev
#+end_src

You will also need a way to open the zipfiles. We have found the best programs to use
is =file-roller= and =pcmanfm= (or some other file manager such as =nautilus=). But use whatever you see fit.

#+begin_src bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install file-roller pcmanfm
#+end_src

For Arch based distributions, run:

#+begin_src bash
  sudo pacman -S gcc
  sudo pacman -S boost
  sudo pacman -S libzip
  sudo pacman -S pcmanfm
  sudo pacman -S file-roller
#+end_src

*** Windows

For windows, we recommend developing with [[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about][WSL]] (Windows Subsystem for Linux).
Please install it if you do not already have it using this [[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install][guide]]. After that,
launch WSL and follow the steps to installing on Linux.

For viewing the zipfiles, we have found that [[https://www.7-zip.org/download.html][7-zip]] works best.

*** Mac

Unfortunately, we have not been able to get the project built on MacOS. We have
decided the the best option for Mac users is to choose a virtual machine to run
some Linux distribution.

Here are some popular VM's:
- [[https://www.qemu.org/][QEMU]] (my favorite but harder to set up)
- [[https://www.virtualbox.org/][Virtualbox]] (easiest but slowest)
- [[https://www.vmware.com/][VMware]] (high quality but paid)

There are many more out there, so choose whichever one suits you best.

Once a VM has been chosen, choose your favorite flavor of Linux and download its ISO
and have the VM use it, then follow the installation on Linux.

** Building

First, clone the repository if not done already:
#+begin_src bash
  git clone https://www.github.com/Lunatic-Labs/pointless-project.git/
#+end_src

Go into the =src/= directory:
#+begin_src bash
  cd ./src/
#+end_src

Then use the =Makefile= to build the project:
#+begin_src bash
  make all <opt>
#+end_src
#+begin_quote
where =opt= is one of:
- =all= \rightarrow perform all =Makefile= flags
- =clean= \rightarrow removes all object files and all generated zipfiles
- =cleanzip= \rightarrow removes all generated zipfiles
#+end_quote

Building the project will create a directory called =obj= where all object files
are located as well as create a =zipfiles= directory where all puzzle zipfiles are
generated. You can now inspect and solve the puzzle(s) by choosing the appropriate zipfile.

* Puzzle Creation Framework

It is obvious to see that there are a lot of directories in this project, and not all
of them contain code. In fact, most of these directories contains the necessary resources
for their respective puzzle.

Any directory that starts with =files-= are resource directories. They contain (at least) the =.desc.txt=
for each puzzle as well as any supporting files that the puzzle needs (other HTML files, images, etc).

#+begin_quote
*Any support files that are prefixed with `.` will not be included in the zipped-up
puzzle. Files that do not have this prefix will be included in the zipfile.*
#+end_quote

Each puzzle's generated HTML page (=instructions.html=) has a specific structure:

| Instructions.html  |
|--------------------|
| Header (generated) |
| Body (.desc.txt)   |
| Footer (generated) |

The HTML /Header/ and /Footer/ are located in =src/resources/= and do
not need to be touched (unless changes are needed).

Below is a UML diagram of how a puzzle gets created.

* Implementing a New Puzzle

Implementing a new puzzle is increadibly easy with how we implemented it. Here are the steps
to take when doing so.

** Puzzle Resources Directory

Start by creating a new directory in =src/= and name it =files-<new puzzle name>=.
Then inside of there, create a new file called =.desc.txt=. This is where the instructions,
hints, and other info about the puzzle is stored. Everything in this file will be put into an HTML file,
so make sure that it follows the HTML rules.

In order to transfer information easily from C++ to HTML/Javascript, we use a special delimiter in this file,
namely =%DELIM=. For example, if I need to pass a password and an array that is generated in C++
into this =.desc.txt= file, I would do something like:

#+CAPTION: =.desc.txt= example
#+begin_src javascript
  <script>
    let password = %DELIM;
    let array = [%DELIM];
  </script>
#+end_src

It is then the job of C++ to "stringify" the required information to pass to =.desc.txt=.
In order to make the explanation more easy to follow, I will make a new puzzle called "fib",
where the point(less) of it is to have the user find the /n^th/ number of the fibonacci sequence.

#+CAPTION: Creating =src/files-fib/.desc.txt=
#+begin_src bash
  cd ./src/
  mkdir files-fib && cd files-fib
  echo "What is the <b>%DELIM</b>th number in the fibonacci sequence?" > .desc.txt
#+end_src

** Puzzle Implementation

Once the above step is done, create a new file called =<puzzle name>-puzzle.cpp=
in =src/= and put the entrypoint of the function that will create the puzzle.
We will also need to include =./include/puzzle.h= to have access to the =Puzzle= object.

#+CAPTION: =src/fib-puzzle.cpp=
#+begin_src c++
  #include "./include/puzzle.h"

  Puzzle fib_puzzle_create(long seed)
  {
    return {"files-fib", "changeme", {}}; // NOTE: "files-fib" is the puzzle requirements directory from the previous step.
  }
#+end_src

The return value of this function is a =Puzzle= object. It is defined as:

#+CAPTION: =src/include/puzzle.h=
#+begin_src c++
struct Puzzle {
  // The filepath to the appropriate directory
  // that contains all of the information needed
  // for the puzzle.
  std::string contents_fp;

  std::string password;

  std::optional<std::string> extra_info;
};
#+end_src

#+begin_quote
So we are returning a new puzzle where

- requirements = "files-fib"
- password = "changeme"
- extra info = None
#+end_quote

The =password= field is what will set the password for the next zipfile layer.
The =extra_info= field is purely for debugging and is strictly used for the side
effect of printing when running the application. Nothing that gets put into it will
be displayed/used in the final puzzle in the zipfiles.

Now it's time to actually create the solver for the puzzle. I will create a fib function that will find the number.

#+CAPTION: Complete source of =src/fib-puzzle.cpp=
#+begin_src c++
  #include "./include/puzzle.h"
  #include "./include/utils.h" // utils_rng_roll, utils_html_printf, utils_generate_file

  static int fib(int n)
  {
    if (n < 2) return n;
    return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2);
  }

  Puzzle fib_puzzle_create(long seed)
  {
    // Get a random number in the range 3..=10.
    int fibnum = utils_rng_roll(3, 10, seed);

    // Get the solution to the puzzle.
    int password = fib(fibnum);

    // Generate the HTML content to be displayed to the user
    std::string html_content = utils_html_printf("Fibonacci Sequence",
                                                 "./files-fib/.desc.txt",
                                                 {std::to_string(fibnum)});

    // Create the instructions.html
    utils_generate_file("./files-fib/instructions.html", html_content);

    // Finally return the Puzzle object.
    return {"files-fib", std::to_string(password), {}};
  }
#+end_src

Now that the implementation is done, add the signature of =fib_puzzle_create= to =./src/include/puzzle.h=.

** Using the Puzzle

In the =main= function in =main.cpp=, there is some code that looks like:

#+CAPTION: src/main.cpp
#+begin_src c++
  std::vector<Puzzle> puzzles = {
    math_puzzle_create(seed),
    color_puzzle_create(seed),
    pixel_puzzle_create(seed),
    maze_puzzle_create(seed),
    encrypt_puzzle_create(seed),
    based_puzzle_create(seed),
    ast_puzzle_create(seed),
    fin_puzzle_create(seed),
  };
#+end_src

Put the new puzzle that was created in the spot that you want it to
appear in the nested zipfiles. For example, if I want it to be the
third puzzle that the user solves, I would do:

#+CAPTION: src/main.cpp
#+begin_src c++
  std::vector<Puzzle> puzzles = {
    math_puzzle_create(seed),
    color_puzzle_create(seed),
    fib_puzzle_create(seed), // Added it here
    pixel_puzzle_create(seed),
    maze_puzzle_create(seed),
    encrypt_puzzle_create(seed),
    based_puzzle_create(seed),
    ast_puzzle_create(seed),
    fin_puzzle_create(seed),
  };
#+end_src

Now run =make all= and these things will happen:

#+begin_quote
- The =files-<puzzle name>= directories will all generate a file called =instructions.html=.
- =./src/zipfiles/= will be populated with zipfiles.
#+end_quote

The entire project will be located in =./src/zipfiles/puzzle1.zip=, as it contains
the zipped files /puzzle1..puzzleN/. The reason why we also generate the other puzzles
outside of =puzzle1.zip=, is because it allows for easy testing without having to go through the entire zipfile structure.

* Current Puzzles

** Math

This puzzle serves as the /Hello, World!/ puzzle. It introduces the user
to reading the description, solving the puzzle, and inputing the password.

We prompt the user to solve a very simple math question and that solution is the password.

** TODO Color

** TODO Pixel

** TODO Maze

** TODO Encrypt

** TODO Based

** Rematches
The "rematch" puzzles serve as the point in the project where there is a
noticable difficulty spike. It interrupts the linear nested puzzle format
by having the user solve three harder versions of previous puzzles. Each one
of these rematch puzzles gives a piece of the password to advance past this
rematch section.

*** TODO Maze Rematch

*** TODO Encrypt Rematch

*** TODO Based Rematch

** TODO Ast

** TODO Binary Addition (Graph Paper Robot I)

** TODO Logic Gate (Graph Paper Robot II)

** TODO (Graph Paper Robot III)
