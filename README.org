* Introduction

#+begin_quote
The point(less) of the /Pointless Project/ is to create a compelling, puzzle-filled
challenge inspired by the [[https://challenge.synacor.com][Synacor Challenge]], but targeted at a pre-college audience.
The goal is to allow the School of Computing (SoC) to engage potential
students during the time they are selecting a college by providing opportunities to remain in
contact, encourage curiosity, and engage in creative problem solving while learning about
computing and the SoC.

Playing through the Synacor Challenge will provide the clearest understanding, however reading
someone else's "[[https://github.com/KanegaeGabriel/synacor-challenge/blob/master/writeup.md][travel log]]" is also insightful. The key components to success include:
1. a personalized download containing the complete game
2. the ability to play completely offline
3. a series of different but related logic puzzles and riddles
4. multiple opportunities "along the way" to be recognized for their problem solving skills.

* Project Setup

** Installation

*** Linux (/recommened/)

For Debian based distributions, run:

#+begin_src bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install g++ libboost-all-dev libzip-dev
#+end_src

You will also need a way to open the zipfiles. We have found the best programs to use
is =file-roller= and =pcmanfm= (or some other file manager such as =nautilus=). But use whatever you see fit.

#+begin_src bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install file-roller pcmanfm
#+end_src

For Arch based distributions, run:

#+begin_src bash
  sudo pacman -S gcc
  sudo pacman -S boost
  sudo pacman -S libzip
  sudo pacman -S pcmanfm
  sudo pacman -S file-roller
#+end_src

*** Windows

For windows, we recommend developing with [[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about][WSL]] (Windows Subsystem for Linux).
Please install it if you do not already have it using this [[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install][guide]]. After that,
launch WSL and follow the steps to installing on Linux.

For viewing the zipfiles, we have found that [[https://www.7-zip.org/download.html][7-zip]] works best.

*** Mac

Unfortunately, we have not been able to get the project built on MacOS. We have
decided the the best option for Mac users is to choose a virtual machine to run
some Linux distribution.

Here are some popular VM's:
- [[https://www.qemu.org/][QEMU]] (my favorite but harder to set up)
- [[https://www.virtualbox.org/][Virtualbox]] (easiest but slowest)
- [[https://www.vmware.com/][VMware]] (high quality but paid)

There are many more out there, so choose whichever one suits you best.

Once a VM has been chosen, choose your favorite flavor of Linux and download its ISO
and have the VM use it, then follow the installation on Linux.

** Building

First, clone the repository if not done already:
#+begin_src bash
  git clone https://www.github.com/Lunatic-Labs/pointless-project.git/
#+end_src

Go into the =src/= directory:
#+begin_src bash
  cd ./puzzle-code/src/
#+end_src

Then use the =Makefile= to build the project:
#+begin_src bash
  make <opt>
#+end_src
#+begin_quote
where =opt= is one of:
- =all= \rightarrow perform all =Makefile= flags
- =clean= \rightarrow removes all object files and all generated zipfiles
- =cleanzip= \rightarrow removes all generated zipfiles
#+end_quote

Building the project will create a directory called =obj= where all object files
are located as well as create a =zipfiles= directory where all puzzle zipfiles are
generated. You can now inspect and solve the puzzle(s) by choosing the appropriate zipfile.

* Puzzle Creation Framework

It is obvious to see that there are a lot of directories in this project, and not all
of them contain code. In fact, most of these directories contain the necessary resources
for their respective puzzle.

Any directory that starts with =files-= are resource directories. They contain (at least) the =.desc.txt=
for each puzzle as well as any supporting files that the puzzle needs (other HTML files, images, etc).

#+begin_quote
*Any support files that are prefixed with `.` will not be included in the zipped-up
puzzle. Files that do not have this prefix will be included in the zipfile.*
#+end_quote

Each puzzle's generated HTML page (=instructions.html=) has a specific structure:

| Instructions.html  |
|--------------------|
| Header (generated) |
| Body (.desc.txt)   |
| Footer (generated) |

The HTML /Header/ and /Footer/ are located in =puzzle-code/html-txt/resources/= and do
not need to be touched (unless changes are needed).

Below is a UML diagram of how a puzzle gets created.

#+CAPTION: Puzzle Creation UML
[[./imgs/puzzle-uml.png]]

* Implementing a New Puzzle

Implementing a new puzzle is increadibly easy with how we implemented it. Here are the steps
to take when doing so.

** Puzzle Resources Directory

Start by creating a new directory in =src/= and name it =files-<new puzzle name>=.
Then inside of there, create a new file called =.desc.txt=. This is where the instructions,
hints, and other info about the puzzle is stored. Everything in this file will be put into an HTML file,
so make sure that it follows the HTML rules.

In order to transfer information easily from C++ to HTML/Javascript, we use a special delimiter in this file,
namely =%DELIM=. For example, if I need to pass a password and an array that is generated in C++
into this =.desc.txt= file, I would do something like:

#+CAPTION: =.desc.txt= example
#+begin_src javascript
  <script>
    let password = %DELIM;
    let array = [%DELIM];
  </script>
#+end_src

It is then the job of C++ to "stringify" the required information to pass to =.desc.txt=.
In order to make the explanation more easy to follow, I will make a new puzzle called "fib",
where the point(less) of it is to have the user find the /n^th/ number of the fibonacci sequence.

#+CAPTION: Creating =puzzle-code/html-txt/files-fib/.desc.txt=
#+begin_src bash
  cd ./puzzle-code/html-txt/
  mkdir files-fib && cd files-fib
  echo "What is the <b>%DELIM</b>th number in the fibonacci sequence?" > .desc.txt
#+end_src

** Puzzle Implementation

Once the above step is done, create a new file called =<puzzle name>-puzzle.cpp=
in =puzzle-code/src/= and put the entrypoint of the function that will create the puzzle.
We will also need to include =./include/puzzle.h= to have access to the =Puzzle= object.

#+CAPTION: =puzzle-code/src/fib-puzzle.cpp=
#+begin_src c++
  #include "./include/puzzle.h"

  Puzzle fib_puzzle_create(long seed)
  {
    return {"../html-txt/files-fib", "", "changeme", {}}; // NOTE: "../html-txt/files-fib" is the puzzle requirements directory from the previous step.
  }
#+end_src

The return value of this function is a =Puzzle= object. It is defined as:

#+CAPTION: =src/include/puzzle.h=
#+begin_src c++
struct Puzzle {
  // The filepath to the appropriate directory
  // The content of the instruction.html pages
  // that contains all of the information needed
  // for the puzzle.
  std::string contents_fp;
  
  std::string contents_html;

  std::string password;

  std::optional<std::string> extra_info;
};
#+end_src

#+begin_quote
So we are returning a new puzzle where

- requirements = "../html-txt/files-fib"
- html content = ""
- password = "changeme"
- extra info = None
#+end_quote

The =html content= field is a string for the html content of the puzzle.
The =password= field is what will set the password for the next zipfile layer.
The =extra_info= field is purely for debugging and is strictly used for the side
effect of printing when running the application. Nothing that gets put into it will
be displayed/used in the final puzzle in the zipfiles.

Now it's time to actually create the solver for the puzzle. I will create a fib function that will find the number.

#+CAPTION: Complete source of =puzzle-code/src/fib-puzzle.cpp=
#+begin_src c++
  #include "./include/puzzle.h"
  #include "./include/utils.h" // utils_rng_roll, utils_html_printf, utils_generate_file

  static int fib(int n)
  {
    if (n < 2) return n;
    return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2);
  }

  Puzzle fib_puzzle_create(long seed)
  {
    // Get a random number in the range 3..=10.
    int fibnum = utils_rng_roll(3, 10, seed);

    // Get the solution to the puzzle.
    int password = fib(fibnum);

    // Generate the HTML content to be displayed to the user
    std::string html_content = utils_html_printf("Fibonacci Sequence",
                                                 "../html-txt/files-fib/.desc.txt",
                                                 {std::to_string(fibnum)});

    // Create the instructions.html
    utils_generate_file("../html-txt/files-fib/instructions.html", html_content);

    // Finally return the Puzzle object.
    return {"../html-txt/files-fib", html_content, std::to_string(password), {}};
  }
#+end_src

Now that the implementation is done, add the signature of =Puzzle fib_puzzle_create(long)= into =.puzzle-code/src/include/puzzle.h=.

** Using the Puzzle

In the =main= function in =main.cpp=, there is some code that looks like:

#+CAPTION: puzzle-code/src/main.cpp
#+begin_src c++
  std::vector<Puzzle> puzzles = {
    math_puzzle_create(seed),
    color_puzzle_create(seed),
    pixel_puzzle_create(seed),
    maze_puzzle_create(seed),
    encrypt_puzzle_create(seed),
    based_puzzle_create(seed),
    ast_puzzle_create(seed),
    fin_puzzle_create(seed),
  };
#+end_src

Put the new puzzle that was created in the spot that you want it to
appear in the nested zipfiles. For example, if I want it to be the
third puzzle that the user solves, I would do:

#+CAPTION: puzzle-code/src/main.cpp
#+begin_src c++
  std::vector<Puzzle> puzzles = {
    math_puzzle_create(seed),
    color_puzzle_create(seed),
    fib_puzzle_create(seed), // Added it here
    pixel_puzzle_create(seed),
    maze_puzzle_create(seed),
    encrypt_puzzle_create(seed),
    based_puzzle_create(seed),
    ast_puzzle_create(seed),
    fin_puzzle_create(seed),
  };
#+end_src

Now run =make all= and these things will happen:

#+begin_quote
- The =files-<puzzle name>= directories will all generate a file called =instructions.html=.
- =.puzzle-code/src/zipfiles/= will be populated with zipfiles.
#+end_quote

The entire project will be located in =.puzzle-code/src/zipfiles/puzzle1.zip=, as it contains
the zipped files /puzzle1..puzzleN/. The reason why we also generate the other puzzles
outside of =puzzle1.zip=, is because it allows for easy testing without having to go through the entire zipfile structure.

* Current Puzzles

These are the currently implemented puzzles. Each one has three entries.
1. /Adjustable Variables/: Variables can be adjusted to make the puzzle harder/easier
2. /Description/: What the puzzle does
3. /RNG/: What exactly in the puzzles are random

** Math

/Adjustable Variables/:
- =MATH_MIN1=
- =MATH_MAX1=
- =MATH_MIN2=
- =MATH_MAX2=

/Description/:

This puzzle serves as the /Hello, World!/ puzzle. It introduces the user
to reading the description, solving the puzzle, and inputing the password.

We prompt the user to solve a very simple math question in the form of $a$ + $b$.

/RNG/:
- $a$, $b$

** Color

/Adjustable Variables/: /None/

/Description/:

This puzzle asks the user to enter the hex value of one of Lipscomb's colors (purple or yellow).
The goal of this puzzle is to teach the user about hex values. We hope that the user does
some simple Googling to find [[https://teamcolorcodes.com/lipscomb-university-bisons-color-codes/][this website]] to find the colors.

/RNG/:
- purple | yellow

** Pixel

  /Adjustable Variables/:
  - =MAX_LOOP= (*must change number of html elements to match*)
    
  /Description/:

  The goal of this puzzle is to retest the user on their knowledge on [[https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors&ved=2ahUKEwiC5YSTmcqFAxV7fTABHWc-BkcQFnoECD4QAQ&usg=AOvVaw18c4MTcDyUUWEZ5XtahOp3][this website]]
  hexadecimal color codes learned in the "Color" puzzle. The hex codes come directly from the bison svg included in the pages header.

  The user is shown a hex code with along with a number.

    - =#331E54 = 66=

  The number corresponds to the number of pixels of the given hex code found in the bison svg.
  Following the first code/number pair, there are two more rows. The first row will contain two hex codes, an "X" denoting multiplication, and a number.
  The number is the product of the pixel count related to the respective hex codes.

    - =#F4AA00 X #331E54 = 396=

  The final row contains three code/number pairs and a question mark. The user must find the product.

    - =#FFFFFF X #F4AA00 X #000000 = ?=

    /RNG/:
    - The order of hex codes in the arithmetic

** Maze

/Adjustable Variables/:
- =MAZE_SIZE= (*must be an odd number*)

/Description/:

The goal of this puzzle is to teach the user about [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-length_encoding][run-length encoding]].
This encoding algorithm places numbers before the letters, while we expect the numbers to be after.
We do this because it more closely matches function calls in the form of $f \space x \rightarrow n$.

We randomly generate a maze as an SVG and have the user navigate it using the following rules:

| Instruction | Direction |
|-------------+-----------|
| /u/         | up        |
| /d/         | down      |
| /l/         | left      |
| /r/         | right     |

However, the answer is not just the path that you must take (/uulrrrd/ for example), you must
apply the run-length encoding algorithm to it. So the answer would be: /u2lr3d/.

/RNG/:
- The maze that is presented.

** Encrypt

/Adjustable Variables/:

- =ENCR_WORDS=
- =ENCR_OPS=
- =ENCR_ROTATIONS_MIN=
- =ENCR_ROTATIONS_MAX=
- =ENCR_CHANGE_MIN=
- =ENCR_CHANGE_MAX=

/Description/:

This puzzle challenges the user by decrypting the password. We present them with
a list of steps used to encrypt it, and they must undo it to get the password.

The following things can happen:
- shift all characters by $i$ to either the right $(r)$ or left $(l)$
- swap the characters at index $j$ and $k$
- increase each *fourth* letter alphabetically by $n$.

/RNG/:
- The instructions used
- $i$, $r$, $l$, $j$, $k$, $n$

** Intro Base
/Adjustable Variables/:
- =MAX_HEX_ANS_LEN=

/Description/:

The goal of this puzzle is to introduce the player to number bases and base conversion.
The puzzle contains a visual representation of numbers with different bases called a lightbox.
Using these visual representations of bases, the player must convert a lightbox from base 16
to base 10.

/RNG/:
- $num
- lightbox placements

** Rematches
The "rematch" puzzles serve as the point in the project where there is a
noticable difficulty spike. It interrupts the linear nested puzzle format
by having the user solve three harder versions of previous puzzles. Each one
of these rematch puzzles gives a piece of the password to advance past this
rematch section.

*** Maze Rematch

/Adjustable Variables/:
- =MAZE_SIZE= (*must be an odd number*)

/Description/:

This is the harder version of the /Maze/ puzzle. We provide cryptic instructions
in with the goal of having them inspect the page and navigate to the console. Once they
type "instructions" a list of function calls are presented. The user then needs to navigate
the maze $(M_1)$ using these function calls and must explore two other mazes $(M_2, M_3)$ with items that need to
be picked up. Once these items are picked up, they then need to go to $M_1$ and go
to the yellow tile. The password is then presented when they type "exit()".

/RNG/:
- $M_1, M_2, M_3$, password

*** Encrypt Rematch
/Adjustable Variables/:
- =ENCR_WORDS=

/Description/:

This is a harder version of the /Encrypt/ puzzle. It presents the user with an encrypted password
as well as a /not-so-helpful-at-first/ order of steps that were taken. The user must interact with
a textbox on screen and try to figure out that pattern in which the buttons mess with their input.
Once they have figured it out, they must decrypt the password.

/RNG/:
- The password

*** Based Rematch

    /Adjustable Variables/:
      - =CELLS= (*must modify table in .desc.txt to match*)

    /Description/:

      The goal of this puzzle is to teach the user about [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positional_notation#Base_conversion][base conversion]].
      They are given a description of three Pointless-created bases. The actual instructions follow in a story-esque fashion, here they are simplified:
        - Convert values to base 10
        - Sum them up for each row
        - Convert the sum to base 2
        - Check if LSB is on or off
        - Save the resulting LSB values
        - Take that base 2 number and convert it back to base 10 (the rightmost column)

      They are then shown a table with values occupying each cell, except for the right most cell in each row.

      |    24 | F     |     3 | ?     |
      |    11 | 41    |    41 | ?     |
      |     A | 18    |    27 | ?     |
      |    35 | F     |     E | ?     |

      /RNG/:
      - The values in each cell

** BST
/Adjustable Variables/:
- =ROOT_MIN=
- =ROOT_MAX=

/Description/:

The player is presented with a root number. The goal is to create a binary search tree (BST), and trace
the route from the root node to the destination by solving the expression set with your root number.

These are the possible expressions that can show up with examples:
- addition: $a$ + $b$
- subtraction: $a$ - $b$
- multiplication: $a$ * $b$
- division: $a$ / $b$
- square root: √($a$)
- comparisons: $a$ > $b$
- hexadecimal: FFFFFF
- complex expression: √?(($a$ -/+ $b$) +/- ($c$ *||/ $d$))

/RNG/:
- root
- expressions in each path
- path from root \rightarrow destination

** Scrapped Based Rematch

    /Adjustable Variables/:
      - =NUM_VALS= (*must modify html elements to match*)
      - =VAL_SZ=

  /Description/:

  This is a harder version of the /Based/ puzzle that also incorporates sorting. The user is presented with an instructions page outlining the challenge. Hidden on the page are three buttons 
  that, when clicked, enumerate the Pointless-created bases that they will encounter in the actual puzzle.

  The bases:

    - /Symbolic 8/: =!, @, #, $, %, ^, &, *=
    - /Glyphic 16/: ={, }, [, ], (, ), `, >, a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h=
    - /Mystic 36/: =|, ~, ,, /, ?, *, +, =, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z=

  Upon clicking the "Enter" button, they will be brought to the actual puzzle. There are =NUM_VALS= number of values, each of length =VAL_SZ=.
  Clicking on these values places them into the container in the center of the page. The user must fill this container with the values sorted from smallest to greatest.
  Doing so correctly will prompt a modal to appear containing the key.

  /RNG/:

  - The values

** Graph Paper Robot Puzzles

The idea behind this trilogy of paper robot puzzles, is that we want the player to bring out
a piece of graph paper and something to color the squares with and do this all on paper. We want to
teach the player about certain topics in the first two paper robot puzzles (state, memory etc.) then
incorporate those ideas in the last one.

*** Binary Addition (Graph Paper Robot I)
/Adjustable Variables/:
- =TAPE_WIDTH=
- =TAPE_HEIGHT=
- =REQ_CARRIES=

/Description/:

The player is presented with a 2x12 grid of (mostly) red $(r)$ and green $(g)$ pixels. The red pixels means 0
and green means 1. Then, following the rules in the instructions, the player should color in the correct
squares with the correct color. The idea of this puzzle is that the player is actually performing binary addition.

/RNG/: $r, g$ pixels

*** Logic Gate (Graph Paper Robot II)

/Adjustable Variables/:
- =enum Gate= (*needs implementation*)
- =input length= (unimplemented, *needs to be a power of 2*)

/Description/:

*NOTE*: This puzzle is currently in development, so the description is sparse on purpose.

The player is presented with a grid of colors $(g)$ which are (unknown to the player) logicgates.
These logic gates will be read in by the robot as instructions. The first instruction is in bottom left.
Then the robot reads to the right, and loops back to the left when it reaches the end. (like reading a book, but bottom to top)
There is another robot managing the memory, which are the colored circles $(c)$.
When the first robot reads in a gate, the memory robot pops off the two bits on the left.
The logic gate is then evaluted with those bits, and the result pushed on the right end of memory.

The answer is every evaluation in order.

/RNG/: $g,c$

*** TODO (Graph Paper Robot III)

Currently unimplemented

and it's color as =_fill=.

Optionally can set =_stroke= (use this if you want a border) and =_html_classname= (if you want
to modify it in HTML/JS).

#+begin_src c++
  Svg graphics_gen_svg_from_image(Image &img, float pixel_size);
#+end_src

Creates an =Svg= from =img= using the scaling of =pixel_size=.

*NOTE*: all "dead" pixels are set to transparent.

#+begin_src c++
    void graphics_create_ppm(Image &img, const char *filepath);
#+end_src

Creates a PPM image from =img= and saves it to =filepath=.

#+begin_src c++
  Image graphics_scale_ppm(Image &img, size_t scale);
#+end_src

Scales =img= by =scale= and returns a new =Image=.

*NOTE*: This function is extremely slow as it runs in $O(n^4)$ time.

* Web Server
** Description
The main goals of the webpage are puzzle download, user registration, and user tracking. 
New users are to put their info into the first page, which is saved to a csv file. (Each new user will have a default level of 0)
User downloads the puzzle via php and plays offline. In order to level up, user is to log in to a separate page
where they can submit the hidden tokens and update their level in the csv file via POST request.

#+CAPTION: Webpage User Flow UML
[[./imgs/Pointless_UMLs-Webpage.jpg]]

** How to start
  Download php-cli
#+begin_src bash
  sudo apt-install php-cli
#+end_src
  Change directories to /web-server/
#+begin_src bash
  cd ./pointless-project/web-server
#+end_src
  Start localhost
#+begin_src bash
  php -S localhost:8000
#+end_src
*NOTE*: Keep terminal running to track all requests going to web-server.
** Integration Test format
*** Description
Tests for the webpages will use bash scripting and are found in the integrated-tests directory.
- *NOTE*: Always run these tests in the integrated-tests directory. This is to make sure that the =cd ..= command makes the current working directory (cwd) =web-server=.
**** Naming format:
- test- =webpage= - =FeatureBeingTested= .sh
**** Testing format:
#+begin_src bash
  #!/bin/bash
  cd ..
  touch ./integrated-tests/output_$current_datetime.txt

  # run wget to run action on URL whether it be a GET or POST request and output that to output.txt

  # if-else statements to find desired outcomes using '! grep'

  # delete output.txt (rm ./integrated-tests/output_$current_datetime.txt) and any edits to csv (sed -i '$d' ./includes/contact-data.csv)
#+end_src
*NOTE*: Whenever running tests that manipulate =contact-data.csv= in any way, shape, or form, be sure to include the following bash code.
#+begin_src bash
  # Placed at beginning of test Create a copy of orignal data for verification
  cp ./includes/contact-data.csv ./integrated-tests/original-data_$current_datetime.csv

  # ..... test body .......

  
  # Check integrity of contact-data.csv 
  if diff ./includes/contact-data.csv ./integrated-tests/original-data.csv; then
      echo 'Changes to contact-data.csv?: No, data is intact.'
      rm ./integrated-tests/original-data_$current_datetime.csv
  else
      echo 'Changes to contact-data.csv?: !!contact-data.csv compromised!! Check for changes!!'
  fi
#+end_src

** Sandbox directory
This directory is to be used for testing any new code or methods, so as not to interfere with any of the
main code. Feel free to delete any files in this directory if needed.

** Future goals
- Consistent dark mode between pages
- Functioning download button in download.php
  - Goal: user retrieves 7zip file from webpage via php
    - This is where you connect the web-server code with the puzzle-code.
    - What's on the current page is just a demo.

* Automated Tests

Go into the =test/= directory:
#+begin_src bash
  cd ./puzzle-code/test/
#+end_src

Then use the =Makefile= to build the project:
#+begin_src bash
  make <opt>
#+end_src
#+begin_quote
where =opt= is one of:
- =all= \rightarrow perform all =Makefile= flags and starts the automated testing process
- =clean= \rightarrow removes all object files
#+end_quote

* Implementing New Tests

** Test Implementation

Create a new file called =<puzzle name>-puzzle-test.cpp=
in =test/= and put the entrypoint of the function that will create the puzzle.
We will also need to include =../src/include/puzzle.h= to have access to the =Puzzle= object,
and =./include/test.h= to have access to the different puzzle test functions.

#+begin_src c++
#include "./include/test.h"
#include "./include/file.h"
#include "../src/include/puzzle.h"

bool fib_puzzle_test()
{
  Puzzle test;
  std::string header_content = file_contents("../html-txt/resources/header.txt");
  std::string footer_content = file_contents("../html-txt/resources/footer.txt");
  size_t found;

  std::cout << "starting fib puzzle tests" << std::endl;
  // Different assert() tests
  std::cout << "fib puzzle test successful\n" << std::endl;

  return true;
}
#+end_src

Now it's time to create an automated test for puzzle. I will create a fib test function to see if the fib function
works correctly.

#+begin_src c++
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <cassert>
#include "./include/test.h"
#include "./include/file.h"
#include "../src/include/puzzle.h"
#include "../src/include/utils.h"

bool fib_puzzle_test()
{
  Puzzle test;
  std::string header_content = file_contents("../html-txt/resources/header.txt");
  std::string footer_content = file_contents("../html-txt/resources/footer.txt");
  size_t found;

  std::cout << "starting fib puzzle tests" << std::endl;
  test = fib_puzzle_create(1);
  assert(test.password == "1");
  found = test.contents_html.find(header_content);
  assert(found != std::string::npos);
  found = test.contents_html.find(footer_content);
  assert(found != std::string::npos);

  test = fib_puzzle_create(5);
  assert(test.password == "5");
  found = test.contents_html.find(header_content);
  assert(found != std::string::npos);
  found = test.contents_html.find(footer_content);
  assert(found != std::string::npos);

  test = fib_puzzle_create(10);
  assert(test.password == "55");
  found = test.contents_html.find(header_content);
  assert(found != std::string::npos);
  found = test.contents_html.find(footer_content);
  assert(found != std::string::npos);
  
  test = fib_puzzle_create(15);
  assert(test.password == "610");
  found = test.contents_html.find(header_content);
  assert(found != std::string::npos);
  found = test.contents_html.find(footer_content);
  assert(found != std::string::npos);
  std::cout << "fib puzzle test successful\n" << std::endl;

  return true;
}
#+end_src

Now that the implementation is done, add the signature of =bool fib_puzzle_test();= into =./puzzle-code/test/include/test.h=.

** Using the Test

In the =main= function in =main.cpp=, there is some code that looks like:

#+begin_src c++
std::vector<bool> tests = {
  math_puzzle_test(),
  color_puzzle_test(),
  pixel_puzzle_test(),
  maze_puzzle_test(),
  based_intro_puzzle_test(),
  encrypt_puzzle_test(),
  rematch_puzzle_test(),
  rematch_maze_puzzle_test(),
  rematch_encrypt_puzzle_test(),
  rematch_based_puzzle_test(),
  binary_addition_puzzle_test(),
  logicgate_puzzle_test(),
  bst_puzzle_test(),
  fin_puzzle_test(),
};
#+end_src

Put the new test that was created in the spot that you want it to
appear in the testing process. For example, if I want it to be the
third test that the program will test, I would do:

#+begin_src c++
std::vector<bool> tests = {
  math_puzzle_test(),
  color_puzzle_test(),
  fib_puzzle_test(),  // Added it here
  pixel_puzzle_test(),
  maze_puzzle_test(),
  based_intro_puzzle_test(),
  encrypt_puzzle_test(),
  rematch_puzzle_test(),
  rematch_maze_puzzle_test(),
  rematch_encrypt_puzzle_test(),
  rematch_based_puzzle_test(),
  binary_addition_puzzle_test(),
  logicgate_puzzle_test(),
  bst_puzzle_test(),
  fin_puzzle_test(),
};
#+end_src

Now run =make all= and these things will happen:

#+begin_quote
- If =./puzzle-code/test/obj/= is populated, then remove every object file in it.
- The =<puzzle name>-puzzle.cpp= code will be compiled with the tests.
- Once compiled, the test will run automaticly.
#+end_quote

* Issues

- No support for building on MacOS
- The formatting for the /Binary Addition/ (Graph Paper Robot II) puzzle
  is not formatted correctly
- Issues with accessing the zip files on MacOS and Linux without file-roller. It immediately
  prompts for a password even though it should not.
- There is no storyline.
- The puzzle difficulty does not scale smoothly. The earlier puzzles should be harder.
- The /AST/ puzzle is way to difficult to solve. Even some Computer Science students were unable to solve it.
- The formatting on the /AST/ puzzle is very incorrect.
- The /Maze Rematch/ puzzle needs a better description.
- Missing required "whitty" quotes on all puzzles.
- Need some way of keeping track of the seed in some meta-data in case the student is stuck. Lipscomb needs
  to figure out the seed that they have so help can be offered.
- The rematch puzzles produce "pieces" of the final password, and the user must concat them together. However,
  this does not work if the user decides to do them in a non-linear order. Maybe just add the numbers together?
