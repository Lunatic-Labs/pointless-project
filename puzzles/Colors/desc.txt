Welcome to the Pointless Computing Challenge!

This Mission Briefing contains everything you need to complete your personal challenge, however you should feel free to use additional resources, including the whole Internet.

While It's the Journey That Counts, you may periodically claim pointless Victory Points by recording your progress at lipscomb.challenge.edu. You can even do it right now using this Free Sample Coupon "H3fisE7jkQ0W".
