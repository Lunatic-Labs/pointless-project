Welcome to the Pointless Computing Challenge!

This Mission Briefing contains everything you need to complete your personal challenge, however you should feel free to use additional resources, including the whole Internet.
<br /> <br />
Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is a classic Fetch Quest involving a lot of puzzles and ultimately the coveted MacGuffin (make sure to keep track of all your points that you will earn).
<br /> <br />

Unfortunately for you, the path to the next puzzle is locked and requires a unique password to gain access to more points.

The password is the way to access the next zip file.
