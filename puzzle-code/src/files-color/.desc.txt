Our normal counting system is in base-10 <code>[0,1,2,...,9]</code> <i>10 digits</i>. <br />
Hexadecimal on the other hand is base-16 <code>[0,1,2,...,9,A,B,C,D,E,F]</code> <i>16 digits</i> where 10-15 are represented as letters.
<br />
<br />
A color is defined by its <i>red, green</i>, and <i>blue</i> values.
When defining a color in hexadecimal, red is the first two numbers, green is the middle two numbers, and blue is the last two numbers.
